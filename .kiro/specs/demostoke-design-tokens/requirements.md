# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves updating the design system to match the authentic DemoStoke brand colors, typography, spacing, and design tokens. Currently, the design system uses generic color tokens that don't represent the actual DemoStoke color palette from www.demostoke.com. This update will ensure brand consistency and proper light/dark mode support.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a designer using the DemoStoke design system, I want the color palette to match the authentic DemoStoke brand colors, so that all components and interfaces maintain brand consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the design system THEN the primary colors SHALL match the DemoStoke brand palette from www.demostoke.com
2. WHEN using color tokens THEN they SHALL reflect the actual DemoStoke color scheme
3. WHEN switching between light and dark modes THEN the colors SHALL adapt appropriately while maintaining brand identity
4. WHEN viewing components THEN they SHALL use the correct DemoStoke brand colors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer implementing DemoStoke components, I want proper light and dark mode color tokens, so that the interface adapts correctly to user preferences while maintaining visual hierarchy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is in light mode THEN all color tokens SHALL use the light mode DemoStoke palette
2. WHEN the system is in dark mode THEN all color tokens SHALL use the dark mode DemoStoke palette
3. WHEN colors are defined THEN they SHALL include both light and dark variants
4. WHEN switching themes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and all elements SHALL update correctly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the design system, I want typography to match the DemoStoke brand guidelines, so that text appears consistent with the main DemoStoke website.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is displayed THEN it SHALL use the same font families as www.demostoke.com
2. WHEN viewing headings THEN they SHALL match the DemoStoke typography scale
3. WHEN reading body text THEN it SHALL use the correct font weights and sizes from DemoStoke
4. WHEN viewing the design system THEN typography SHALL be consistent across all components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a designer working with the design system, I want spacing and layout tokens to match DemoStoke standards, so that components have consistent spacing and proportions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are spaced THEN they SHALL use the DemoStoke spacing scale
2. WHEN viewing layouts THEN they SHALL match the proportions used on www.demostoke.com
3. WHEN using design tokens THEN spacing values SHALL be consistent with DemoStoke brand guidelines
4. WHEN building interfaces THEN the spacing SHALL create visual harmony matching the DemoStoke aesthetic

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using the design system, I want updated CSS custom properties and Tailwind configuration, so that the new DemoStoke tokens are available throughout the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using CSS custom properties THEN they SHALL reflect the DemoStoke color palette
2. WHEN using Tailwind classes THEN they SHALL map to the correct DemoStoke colors
3. WHEN building components THEN the new tokens SHALL be immediately available
4. WHEN the system loads THEN all existing components SHALL automatically use the updated DemoStoke tokens
